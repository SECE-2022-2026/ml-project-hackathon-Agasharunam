Problem Statement: Predict stock prices using historical stock data with
an LSTM model.

Hints:
• Data Preparation: Load historical stock data (open, close, volume) and
create time series sequences.
• Data Normalization: Normalize the data to ensure the LSTM can learn
effectively (use MinMaxScaler).

• LSTM Model: Create an LSTM model with one or more LSTM layers,
followed by a dense layer.
• Training: Split the data into training and testing sets, and use Mean
Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function.
• Prediction: Visualize predictions vs actual values to evaluate
performance.
